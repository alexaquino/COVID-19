Reanimation with usage of Respirator or Venturi’s Valve requires positive ending
pressure in lungs during the expiration. This prevents lungs from collapse and
failure. Standard PEEP valves are very expensive and rarely adjustable. With a
tricky mixture of gravity and the weight of coins (same currency) all over the
world I managed to design printable PEEP valve with pressure range starting from
2,9 mm H2O. Pressure range is only limited with height of water in a bottle, where
the pressure measurement takes place. Difference between fluid levels in bottle
and transparent hose responds to pressure difference between environment and
patient’s lungs. Pressure-limiting cylinder’s body outlet is directly connected
with conical tube containing flow measurement element. Flow can be observed with
indicator sticking out from the top of structure. The higher the flow is, the
higher it will be. Expirational gases escape to the atmosphere through the filter
where most of aerosols should be stopped. Project is ready to download, print and
test.

During reanimation the air inflates lungs with pressure higher than environmental.
If it would be released to the atmosphere directly, air pressure could drop below
level of normal operation. So there is a need to keep Positive Ending Expiratory
Pressure (PEEP). It can be done with pressure-keeping valve or mechanism. Rieger
produces kind of valves in Germany for fluids. Positive pressure range starts from
4,5mmH2O (40, 50 Pa) and ends at ~20mmH2O. Standard valve is set to constant pressure,
is single-time use and costs ca. 60-80EUR. My idea was to build valve, that could
be regulated all over the world with common interface. I noticed, that coins have
equal weight in local currency.

With a given pressure, known geometry it was easy to calculacte formula for reaction
force for cylinder. Force is generated from mass of cylinder, coins and gravity.
I developped design of lightweight cylinder, prepared excel calculation sheet for
user and gave example of coin weights for USD and EUR. This is how the regulating
valve works.

I wanted to have flow and pressure data without external flowmeter and pressure meter.
There is conical flowmeter with indicator located at the top of requlating valve and
with air filter mounted on outlet from flowmeter. Pressure is measured with a hose in
the bottle filled with water. The higher the pressure is, the lower will free surface
be in a hose and the higher will the differencw between water levels in bottle and hose
be. Pressure in bottle has to be equal to environment so there is a bypass too with
small diameter tube. All parts can be mounted onto top of standard PET bottle.
Device has integrated hanger for Venturi Valve. :)
