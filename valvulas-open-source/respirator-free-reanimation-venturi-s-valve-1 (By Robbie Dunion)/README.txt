You may have read my recent article explaining how Italian company Isinnova
responded to a call for help from a hospital in Northern Italy to keep their
reanimation devices operational during the Covid-19 pandemic by 3D printing
replacement valves that had become unavailable from their usual suppliers.

Below we have included a link to download the 3D CAD files for these valves, to
ensure that everybody who needs access to them can print their own.

These ready-to-print Venturi's valve models are for respirator-free masks and have
been created as a non-profit project for the Covid-19 pandemic.

Revision 2 (CFD-calculated) available:
* FiO2 = ~33%
* O2 sup. = 10LPM
* Air out. = ~63LPM

2x 25mm O.D. (air suction, patient)
1x 5mm O.D. (oxygen)

Volume of 3D model - 15133 mm3

Revision 1 contains 3 Venturi Valves with:
B = 0,12 ; 0,3 ; 0,5
